# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Workflow
- Content lives in `content/posts/YYYY/slug.md`; keep filenames snake-case and year-based (e.g., `content/posts/2025/control-plane-basics.md`).
- Post assets go in `assets/images/<slug>/`; reference them as `/images/<slug>/file.png` (WITH leading slash) in frontmatter. See `content/posts/2025/claude-k8s-triage.md` as the reference format.
- Theme and config files (e.g., `hugo.yaml`, `themes/`) should be left untouched unless explicitly requested.

## Create or Edit Posts
- Generate a draft with `hugo new posts/YYYY/your-title.md`; use ISO dates and fill required front matter (`title`, `date`, `author`, `description`, `draft`).
- **Draft vs. published is managed through the PR process, NOT the `draft` flag.** Always set `draft: false`. Push the post to the fork (`origin`, `randybias/t0-blog`) `main` branch, which auto-builds the GitHub Pages preview site for review; the post only becomes public when a PR to the production blog (`Mirantis/t0-blog`) is merged. Do not use `draft: true` — GitHub Pages does not render draft posts, so it would defeat the preview. The fork-preview-then-PR-to-production flow is the gate, not the frontmatter flag.
- Use clear headings, short paragraphs, and fenced code blocks with language hints (`bash`, `yaml`, `python`).
- **Footnotes**: Use proper Markdown footnote syntax with colon after the marker:
  - Reference in text: `some text[^1]`
  - Definition at bottom: `[^1]: Footnote content here` (note the colon!)
  - See `content/posts/2025/claude-k8s-triage.md` for examples

## Post Review & Finalization

**IMPORTANT**: Once the blog post content is mostly written, actively revisit and refine the frontmatter:

### Frontmatter Review Checklist
1. **Description**: Review and improve the SEO description based on the actual content
   - Should be compelling and accurately reflect what readers will learn
   - Include key concepts and value proposition
   - Keep it concise but informative (1-2 sentences)

2. **Tags**: Verify tags match the actual content topics
   - Remove any tags that don't align with the final content
   - Add tags for key concepts that emerged during writing
   - Ensure tags follow conventions (simple, no tools, no category overlap)

3. **Categories**: Confirm categories are appropriate for the final content
   - Ensure they accurately represent the post's domain
   - Verify no overlap with tags

4. **Title**: Reconsider if the title accurately captures the content
   - Should be clear, specific, and engaging
   - Reflects the actual focus of the piece

5. **Slug**: Verify the URL slug is appropriate and won't need to change

### AI Agent Workflow
When working with AI agents on blog posts:
- After content is substantially complete, the agent should **proactively review** all frontmatter
- Agent should provide **specific recommendations** for improving description, tags, and categories based on the actual content
- Agent should **prompt the writer** to approve or modify these recommendations
- Do not assume initial placeholder frontmatter is final

### Tag Conventions
- Keep tags simple and concise; the blog's context helps readers understand
- Prefer shorter, simpler versions of tags:
  - Use `skills` instead of `agent-skills`
  - Use `operations` instead of `it-operations`
  - Use `triage` instead of `incident-triage`
  - Conceptual tags like `ooda-loop` are fine
- **DO NOT** tag specific software or tools (e.g., avoid tags like `goose`, `claude-code`, `kubernetes-tool-name`)
- Focus tags on concepts, methodologies, and domains rather than specific implementations
- All tags should be lowercase with hyphens for multi-word tags (e.g., `aiops`, `cloud-native`)
- **IMPORTANT**: Tags and categories must never overlap. If a term is used as a category (e.g., `operations`, `engineering`), do not also use it as a tag. Keep the taxonomies separate and distinct.

## Assets & Images

**IMPORTANT**: There are TWO different image locations with different path formats:

### Cover/Featured Images (frontmatter)
- Location: `assets/images/<slug>/`
- Path format in frontmatter: `/images/<slug>/filename.png` (absolute path with leading slash)
- Hugo's asset pipeline processes these automatically

### Inline Images (markdown content)
- Location: `static/images/<slug>/`
- Path format in markdown: `../images/<slug>/filename.png` (relative path)
- These are served directly without processing

### Why two locations?
- `assets/` images are processed by Hugo's asset pipeline (used for frontmatter `image:` field)
- `static/` images are served directly (required for inline markdown images to work on both production and GitHub Pages preview)
- Using absolute paths (`/images/...`) for inline images breaks on GitHub Pages subdirectory previews

### Image Guidelines
- Keep files under ~1 MB; prefer PNG for screenshots, JPG for photos
- Set `slug: "<slug>"` in front matter to keep URLs stable across environments
- Avoid using emoji shortcodes in posts as they may cause build failures

### Example workflow:
```bash
# Create directories for both locations
mkdir -p assets/images/my-post-slug
mkdir -p static/images/my-post-slug

# Copy cover image to assets (for frontmatter)
cp ~/Downloads/cover.png assets/images/my-post-slug/

# Copy inline images to static (for markdown content)
cp ~/Downloads/screenshot.png static/images/my-post-slug/
```

In frontmatter:
```yaml
image: "/images/my-post-slug/cover.png"
```

In markdown content:
```markdown
![Screenshot](../images/my-post-slug/screenshot.png)
```

See `content/posts/2025/claude-k8s-triage.md` as the reference format.

## Preview & Build
- Local preview with live reload: `npm run dev` (runs Tailwind watch + Hugo server at `http://localhost:1313`).
- Hugo-only preview (faster when not changing CSS): `hugo server -D`.
- Production build: `npm run build` (minified Tailwind + Hugo).

## GitHub Actions & Deployment

### Tracking Deployments
After pushing commits, always verify the build and deployment:

1. **List recent workflow runs**:
   ```bash
   gh run list --limit 5
   ```
   This shows the status of recent builds (in_progress, completed success, completed failure).

2. **View specific run details**:
   ```bash
   gh run view <run-id>
   ```
   Use the run ID from the list to see detailed job information and logs.

3. **Watch a run in progress**:
   ```bash
   gh run watch <run-id>
   ```
   Monitor an active deployment in real-time.

4. **Check the preview site**:
   - **IMPORTANT**: Set `draft: false` in frontmatter before pushing - GitHub Pages does not render draft posts (unlike local `hugo server -D`)
   - Access your fork's GitHub Pages preview URL (typically `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`)
   - Verify your post appears correctly with images displaying properly
   - Test all links and formatting before creating a PR to production

### Deployment Workflow
1. Push commits to origin/main
2. Run `gh run list --limit 5` to get the latest run ID
3. Run `gh run view <run-id>` to verify build success
4. Visit preview URL to visually verify the post
5. Only create PR to production blog after successful preview verification

### Claude Code Browser Integration
To enable Claude Code to review blog posts live on the GitHub Pages preview site, start Claude Code with the `--chrome` flag:
```bash
claude --chrome
```
This allows Claude to navigate to the preview URL, take screenshots, verify images load correctly, check link formatting, and identify visual issues without requiring manual verification.

## Quality & Style
- Write in an instructional, engineering-focused tone; avoid marketing language.
- Use consistent casing: headings in Title Case; filenames in snake-case; tags/categories in lowercase.
- Check links, images, and code snippets render correctly; prefer concise examples over theory.

## Commit & PR Guidelines

### Commits
- Short imperative subject (e.g., `add post on aiops runbooks`)
- One logical change per commit
- Follow Conventional Commits format when appropriate

### Pull Requests
When creating PRs to the production blog (Mirantis/t0-blog), use this format:

**Summary Section** (1-2 paragraphs):
- Brief description of the blog post topic and key themes
- Blog content speaks for itself - avoid extensive detail
- **Do NOT include preview URLs** (keep unpublished content private)

**Documentation Updates Section** (if applicable):
- Document any AGENTS.md improvements
- Note any workflow or process changes
- Keep this section detailed - helps future contributors

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Blog post content complete
- [ ] Frontmatter properly configured
- [ ] Images in correct location (`assets/images/`)
- [ ] Draft mode disabled
- [ ] Tags follow conventions (no tool names, no category overlap)
- [ ] Footnotes use proper Markdown syntax (if applicable)
- [ ] AGENTS.md updated with learnings (if applicable)

**What NOT to include**:
- Detailed blog post content breakdown (readers can see the post)
- Preview URLs (keeps content private until publication)
- Excessive bullet points about post topics
- Line-by-line frontmatter details

**Example PR command**:
```bash
gh pr create --repo Mirantis/t0-blog \
  --title "Add blog post: Your Title Here" \
  --body "$(cat your-pr-template.md)"
```

- Do not modify theme/config unless the task explicitly requires it; note any deviations in the PR description.
